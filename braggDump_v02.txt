---- Modify v01 and use a struct ----

Create an "Event" struct, with members corresponding to the data
(event identifier, number of measurements, list of energies)

***
Use a dynamic array for the list of energy losses

***
Create a function "read" taking as argument an input file stream,
reading an event and returning a pointer to the event or zero 
at the file end.

***
Create a function "dump" taking as argument a reference to const-event
and printing a dump on the scre en.

***
Create a function "clear" deleting the event and its content.

***
Create a "main" function taking the file name from the command string, 
reading the file and calling the dump and clear functions.
